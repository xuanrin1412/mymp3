Kick in the door, waving the coco
Papkonina chaenggyeo kkyeodeul saenggak malgo
I talk that talk, runways I walk, walk
Nun gamgo Pop, pop an bwado cheok
One by one, then two by two
Nae sonkkeut tuk hanae da muneojineun jung
Gajja syo chigon hwaryeohaetji
Makes no sense
You couldn't get a dollar outta me
Ja oneul bamiya nan dogeul pumeun kkot
Ne honeul ppaeaseun daeum
Look what you made us do
Cheoncheonhi neol jamjaeul fire
Janinhal mankeum areumdawo
I bring the pain like
This, that Pink Vеnom
This, that Pink Venom
This, that Pink Venom
Get 'еm, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to ya dome like
Ah, ah, ah
Taste that Pink Venom
Taste that Pink Venom
Taste that Pink Venom
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to ya dome like
Ah, ah, ah
Black paint and ammo
Got bodies like Rambo
Rest in peace, please light up a candle
This the life of a vandal masked up
And I'm still in Celine
Designer crimes or it wouldn't be me
Diamonds shining, drive in silence
I don't mind it I'm riding
Flying private side by side
With the pilot up in the sky
And I'm wilding
Styling on them and there's no chance
'Cause we got bodies on bodies
Like this a slow dance
Ja oneul bamiya nan dogeul pumeun kkot
Ne honeul ppaeaseun daeum
Look what you made us do
Cheoncheonhi neol jamjaeul Fire
Janinhal mankeum areumdawo
I bring the pain like
This, that Pink Venom
This, that Pink Venom
This, that Pink Venom
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to ya dome like
Ah, ah, ah
Taste that Pink Venom
Taste that Pink Venom
Taste that Pink Venom
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to ya dome like
Ah, ah, ah
Wonhandamyeon provoke us
Gamdang mothae and you know this
Imi peojyeobeorin shot that potion
Ne nunapeun pingkeubit ocean
Come and give me all the smoke
Do animyeon mo like
I'm so rock and roll
Come and give me all the smoke
Da jul sewo bwa ja stop, drop
I bring the pain like
